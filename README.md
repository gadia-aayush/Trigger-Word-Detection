### Readme- Trigger Word Detection

#### Brief Description-
- Here we have created a speech dataset and implemented an algorithm for trigger word detection to word “Activate”. Every time our algorithm hears the word “Activate”; it will make a “chiming” sound. This is very similar to Amazon Alexa or Google Home.

#### Methods Used-
- GRU
- Dropout Normalization
- Batch Normalization
- Convulation 1D
- Dense & Sigmoid Layer

#### Technologies Used-
- Python
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- PyDub

#### Getting Started-
- Just clone the entire repo and run the Jupyter Notebook.

#### Output-
- Here we see that their is a chime in the audio once "activate" word has been said.
